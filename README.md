# Simple-Calculator

This is a simple calculator program in python that takes a user inputted string and parses the numbers and arithmetic symbols from that string to return a calculated total.

The calculator only has support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator currently does not support the usage of parentheses.

This is simply a project for fun.
