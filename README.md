# Simple-Calculator

This is a simple calculator program in python that takes a user inputted string and parses the numbers and arithmetic symbols from that string to return a calculated total.

The calculator only has support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator currently does not support order of operations, all calculations will be done from left to right. This limitation also includes the usage of parentheses.

This is simply a project for fun.
